# PCA for Gene Data

**PCA_GeneData.ipynb** is an interactive notebook.   
**PCA_GeneData_fun.py** is the file which contains the function.  
**Calling_PCA_fun.ipynb** is the file demonstrating how to import the function from **PCA_GeneData_fun.py**.  

## Dataset

**Assignment-2_gene_data- (2) (1) (1).csv** is the file containing gene data.  
**Assignment-2 Meta data sheet (2) (1) (1) (1).csv** is the file containing meta data.  
**Assignment-2 (2) (1) (1) (1).pdf** contains the information about the data and the problem statement.  

## Conclusion

As we can see from the plots that samples from the same timepoints are clustered together.
This means that genes at the same timepoints behave similarly and genes at different timepoints behave differently.
